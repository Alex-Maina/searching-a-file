# searching-a-file
This is a program that does a search in a file (names.txt) which contains names and ages of various people.

Expectations:

1. Open a new Python program file. Define a function named searchname(). In this function, open the file “names.txt” and print its contents using a loop.(https://github.com/Alex-Maina/searching-a-file/blob/main/printing_file_contents.py)
2. Modify the program so that it prints only the lines where the name starts with the letter “A”. (https://github.com/Alex-Maina/searching-a-file/blob/main/printing_selected_content.py)
3.Modify the program so that it first reads a letter from the user, and then prints onlythe lines where the name starts with that letter. Handle the lower/upper case issue. EXTRA: Let the user search with a longer string. E.g. Search with Ah instead of A. (https://github.com/Alex-Maina/searching-a-file/blob/main/search_by_name.py)
4. Define a new function named searchage().Modify the code such that it prints only the lines where the age is equal to 5. (https://github.com/Alex-Maina/searching-a-file/blob/main/search_age.py)
5. Modify searchage() such that it gets the search age from the user. (https://github.com/Alex-Maina/searching-a-file/blob/main/search_by_age.py)
6. Add the main() function to the program. The program should start from here. In this function, print the choices 1-search with name and 2-search with age as a menu and ask the user to choose one. Call the function searchname() or searchage() based on the number the user enters. If the user enters a number other than 1 or 2, print a warning message and end the program (https://github.com/Alex-Maina/searching-a-file/blob/main/menu_search.py)
